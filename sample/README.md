# Technical Task for Full Stack Developer

This technical task is an opportunity for you to show us your technical skills, creativity 
and the communication we can expect from you if you were to become part of the Development team here at Geomiq.

**Main task**

Create an upload form that can be used for uploading 3D Printing part files.

The form should allow a user to upload a part and see a thumbnail image of the uploaded part.

Two example 3D Printing STL files for uploading to the form are provided.

**Constraints**

1. Bleeding-edge Laravel and Vue.js
2. Don’t use Bootstrap CSS

No need for any auth scaffolding – users can all be assumed to be ‘guests’.

**Deliverables**

Provide your submission to us as via a link to a _private_ git repository, or in a zipped folder complete with a readme containing setup instructions. Please do not send us a link to a public git repo, these then become a source of plagiarism for future candidates.

The project readme should contain:

- A complete list of setup instructions.
- Any assumptions you've made.
- How long you spent on the test.
- What you'd do given more time.
- What you thought of the test.
- A description of yourself in json.
